# Development Updates

This document includes all development updates by contributors to EPF cohort 6. [Learn more](/program-guide/repo-guide.md#development-updates) about creating your development updates.

Add your name **alphabetically** and link your updates to the corresponding tables below by opening a PR. Iterate the numbers of your updates and always place them into the current week. Editing a big raw markdown table can cause problems, use an editing environment supporting markdown table formatting or a [formatter tool](https://github.com/nvuillam/markdown-table-formatter).

## Phase 1: Discovery

Phase one is the very beginning of the cohort. The first few weeks are dedicated to general learning about the EPF program, the Ethereum protocol as a whole and its development. Use resources from [EPF Study group](https://epf.wiki) to get started and make yourself familiar with various areas of Ethereum.

## Phase 2: Deep dive

With the gained insight into the protocol, the following weeks serve as a deep dive into a chosen topic. Read about [proposed projects](/projects/project-ideas.md) and choose one to dive into. By the first month, you should finish the initial research about a specific problem and propose a project, including a roadmap. Get some ideas from the [project proposal template](projects/project-template.md).

| Name/GH | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Project proposal |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------------- |
|         |        |        |        |                  |

## Phase 3: Execution

The actual project development is the main part of the program. Post your regular progress updates here during the development phase, share your issues and successes with others.

## Cohort end

The final weeks of the cohort should mark the finalization of your project. Submit your last dev update which is reflecting the overall project progress, its next steps and your experience with EPF. You can also link a video or document presenting the final stage of your project.

| Name/GH | Final report | Project presentation |
